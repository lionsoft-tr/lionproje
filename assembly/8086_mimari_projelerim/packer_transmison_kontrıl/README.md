## Abstract
Consider the maximum capacity of a network is 128 packets. The user starts his packets
transmission by 1 packet. Then he/she increases the number of packets according to the
following rules:

If the number of transmitted packets < 64 packets, the number will be doubled.

If the number of transmitted packets â‰¥ 64 packets, the number will be increased by 1.

If the number of transmitted packets = 128 packets, the user will start over and transmit 1
packets and repeat the previous rules.

The input is the size of the transmitted file.

The output is the number of Transmissions used to transmit this file.
