## Abstract
Consider a boiler in a petrochemical factory. Its temperature is measured every 3 minutes.
If the temperature <= 200ºC, a green led will turn on.

If the 200 < temperature < 500ºC, a yellow led will turn on.

If the temperature >= 500ºC, a red led will turn on.

Write a program that reads the temperature every 3 minutes and shows the LED condition.
